<h1>The House that Jerry Built</h1>

<aside class="notes">
Jerry Richardson is one of two current NFL owners who are former NFL players. With that experience and familiarity with the league enabled him to see his dream of bringing an NFL franchise to the Carolina's a come into fruition. Since their inagural season in 1995 as an expansion team the Panthers are the only team in the NFC South to win more then two division titles and are currently looking to defend their back to back titles.

<h1>A Franchise Year</h1>

<aside class="notes">
The Carolina Panthers began the season with low expectations after the loss of breakout wide reciever Kelvin Benjamin to a season ending knee injury. Questions loomed over Cam Newton's head, many wondering how he would respond after signing one of the largest contracts in the NFL. He would go on to have an MVP season, leading his team to a franchise best 15-1 record and a trip to Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara Califorina.

<h1>Offensive Recap</h1>

<aside class="notes">
<p>Carolina had the highest scoring offense in the league averaging over 30 points per game. Notible games were Carolina visiting Dallas on Thanksgiving and a sunday in late November against Washington, both resulted in blow out victories and came with the recognition of a national audience. &lt;&gt;</p>

<h1>Super Cam</h1>
<img src="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/idqnzkbfjwjdp8ul49ye.jpg" title="Super Cam" alt="alt text" /> - NFL MVP - ESPY's NFL player of the year - #1 player in NFL voted by the players - Passing: Cam Newton 3837 yds - Rushing TD’s: Cam Newton 10
<aside class="notes">
Cam Newton. Famous for his fantastic smile and even more fantastic play making ability. In 2015 he introduced America to the dab, a dance he would regularly do on scoring drives. However, he is much more than dance moves and giving footballs to children after his celebrations. He is the first NFL quarterback to throw for 35 touchdowns and run for 10 more in a single season. He was the team leader in rushing touchdowns and also passed for nearly 4,000 yards. His accomplishments earned him the 2015 NFL MVP award.

<h1>J Stew</h1>
<img src="http://sports.cbsimg.net/u/photos/football/nfl/img25476921.jpg" title="J. Stew" alt="alt text" /> - Rushing: Johnathon Stewart 989 yds - Only NFL team with over 100 yds rushing in every game
<aside class="notes">
Jonathan Stewart, a key component of the Panthers offense, enabled Cam to throw the ball by carving up the defense for yard after yard everytime he would touch the ball. Stewart took over as the primary runner after long time Panther Deangello Williams was let go to the Steelers, and he took full advantage establishing himself as a star when healthy.

<h1>Number 88</h1>
<img src="http://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/2016/01/10/mmqb-olsen-greg-sea.jpg" title="Greg Olsen" alt="alt text" /> - 77 catches for a career-high 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns - Arguably the most well-rounded tight end and among the most durable in the league
<aside class="notes">
A matchup nightmere due to his blocking ability as well as his size and physicality. Greg Olsen is entering the twilight years of his career, however shows no signs of slowing down as of yet. By far Cam's favorite target throughout the year 88 drew so much attention from opposing defenses that it opened up room for other playmakers to have an impact.

<h1>No Benjamin No Problem</h1>
<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A3ZWd-PCTmA/maxresdefault.jpg" title="Teddy" alt="alt text" /> - Kelvin Benjamin: season ending knee injury in training camp - Ginn returned to Carolina in 2015 and again nearly doubled his career receiving touchdown total, finding the end zone 10 times.
<aside class="notes">
What an impact they had. Teddy Ginn Jr, Philly Brown, Jerricho Cotchery, and rookie Devin Funchess, all players disregarded by other teams or veterans that had past their prime. Thanks to the protection of an under appreciated offensive line and the ability of Cam Newton to extend plays once they broke down this wide reciever core was able to pick apart other teams secondaries. Led by speedy Ted Ginn with 10 touchdowns, the absence of star wide out Kelvin Benjamin was a non issue for the Panthers.

<section id="defensive-recap" class="slide level1">
<h1>Defensive Recap</h1>
<img src="https://blog.rukkus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Carolina-Panthers.jpeg" title="D-line" alt="alt text" /> - 5167 total yards given up. 6th in NFL - 19.3 pts given up per game. 6th in NFL - 24 interceptions to lead the league
<aside class="notes">
Up until this past season Carolina had built its succcess on the back of its defense. Consistently ranked in the top 10 defenses in the league, and lead by a combination of hard working veterans, young talent, and a certain individual known for his ability to get under star players skin and shut them down... but more on him later.

<section id="hog-mollies" class="slide level1">
<h1>Hog Mollies</h1>
<img src="http://www.wccbcharlotte.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/kawann-short.jpg" title="Short" alt="alt text" /> - 6th in the NFL with 44 sacks - Kawann Short lead the team and tied for 8th in NFL with 11 sacks
<aside class="notes">
GM Dave Gettleman has a core philosophy which he religiously follows when building his roster. He has a certain kind of player in mind, whom he dubbed the term &quot;hog mollies&quot; but it basically means lets get the biggest, fastest, and strongest guys we can and stack them on the line as to apply pressure to the quarterback. This enables room for error in the secondary because it is impossible to throw the ball down field when youve got a 300 pound defensive end brining you down before you have time to develop the play.

<h1>Keep Pounding</h1>

<aside class="notes">
Thomas Davis Sr. is a living embodiment of the Panthers slogan, Keep Pounding, after recovering from 2 torn ACL in his career as well as persevering through breaking his arm in the NFC Championship game to play in the Super Bowl he will make superogetory sacrices to be out on the field with his teammates.

<h1>Captain America</h1>
<img src="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nfl/carolina-panthers/t9fgy6/picture47598360/ALTERNATES/FREE_640/Luke-Kuechly" title="Luke" alt="alt text" /> - Led team with 137 tackles despite missing 3 games - the first player in NFL history with a pick-six in consecutive playoff games
<aside class="notes">
Luke Kuechly is the heart of the defense. A former defensive player of the year in the NFL, Luke overcame missing three games due to a concussion to achieve career highlights of back to back picks against Tony Romo on thanksgiving as well as two pick 6’s in the playoffs to help the Panthers reach the Super Bowl.

<aside class="notes">
<p>The secondary blew up the NFC South this year putting opposing QB's on notice. Led by Kurt Coleman and Josh Norman and with the help of veteran Roman Harper, Peanut Tillman, and the young upcoming Tre Boston, they had the record for most interceptions in the NFL.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-next-chapter" class="slide level1">
<h1>The Next Chapter</h1>
<img src="http://cbssports.com/images/blogs/Super_Bowl_50_Cam_Newton_Press_Conference_Panthers.jpg" title="Super Bowl" alt="alt text" /> - Looking to defend back to back NFC South titles - Josh Norman let go after contract disagreement - Kelvin Benjamin is back
<aside class="notes">
Even after a dissapointing loss in the Super Bowl to Von Miller and the Denver Broncos the 2015 season was the best in franchise histroy. A much deserving MVP Cam Newton and Coach of the Year Ron Rivera have built the foundation to have many more successful years together. Cam Newton may have not changed the way the position is played, his predecessors are to thank for that, he did revolutionize how it is played with enjoyment and a smile. The future is bright for the Panthers, and the reassertion of Benjamin back into the system, despite the loss of star cornerback Josh Norman, should yeild even more accomplishments and acolades in the years to come.
